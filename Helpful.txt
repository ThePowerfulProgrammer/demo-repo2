A Django view is just a Python function that receives a web request and returns a web response. 
Weâ€™re going to use class-based views then map URLs for each view and create an HTML templated for the data returned from the views.


Difference between App_name/template and App_name:function_name


Authenticate
authentication verifies a user is who they claim to be, and authorization determines what an authenticated user is allowed to do. 

>>> from django.contrib.auth.models import User
>>> user = User.objects.create_user('john', 'lennon@thebeatles.com', 'johnpassword')

# At this point, user is a User object that has already been saved
# to the database. You can continue to change its attributes
# if you want to change other fields.
>>> user.last_name = 'Lennon'
>>> user.save()

>>> from django.contrib.auth.models import User
>>> u = User.objects.get(username='john')
>>> u.set_password('new password')
>>> u.save()
